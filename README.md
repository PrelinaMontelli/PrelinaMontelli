Hello there my friend! This is Prelina Montelli (普利琳娜·莫塔里)

I am:

- Currently a student studying at Beijing Union University.
- Still learning C , C#, Java, Python and Swift languages.
- A fan of retro Macintosh and other old Apple products (Also the new ones).
- A shutterbug, currently using  Sony A7M4 with Sony 24-70 GM2.
- ~~A little bit lazy.~~

I am passionate about learning knowledge in various fields and aspects, but in many areas, I only have a superficial understanding.
